# tls_tools

Some random scripts for TLS, specfically Riegl VZ-4000 long-range scanner.

The planner is unfinished - this was the start of a viewshed analysis tool.  QGIS has similar functionality, and I was able to produce the viewshed maps I needed without reinventing the wheel.  

The resolution tool generates plots of point spacing at variable distances for different angular steps.
